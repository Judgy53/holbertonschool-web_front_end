# flexbox

Project where we learn how to use flexbox in css

Most tasks were done using a starter html `_starter.html` and a starter css `_starter.css` files


## 0. Add display flex
Use the starter HTML and CSS files from this task to task 10. Copy the contents of the starter files into the files that you need to produce and make the necessary changes according to the task description.

When using `display: flex;` on a container, all direct children become `flex-items` (and no more inline or block elements).

With display flex, margins are not collapsing as they would with block items. Also remember that flexbox is 1-dimensional system (vs CSS Grid which is a 2 dimensional system)

In the `/* Grid` section within your CSS
- Add a selector for the row class
    - Property: `display`, Value: `flex`

=> Now, all children from the row class are flex items
- Entirely remove the row::after declaration
- Remove the float: left inside [class*='col-']

=> All elements should appear same than before using the float

File: `0-index.html`, `0-styles.css`

## 1. Add new classes on sections
Using the files from the previous task as the base for this task:

In the outermost section tag for `services`
- Add the class `section-services`

In the outermost section tag for `works`
- Add the class `section-works`

In the outermost section tag for `about`
- Add the class `section-about-us`

In the outermost section tag for `latest_news`
- Add the class `section-latest-news`

In the outermost section tag for `testimonial`
- Add the class `section-testimonial`

In the outermost section tag for `contact`
- Add the class `section-contact`

File: `1-index.html`, `1-styles.css`

## 2. Reverse order Latest news cards
Using the files from the previous task for this task:

The `flex-direction` property says how flex items are placed on the main axis and their direction (normal or reversed).

`flex-direction` is sometimes used when doing responsive design. Some elements may appear better when they are in column mode on mobile and row when on desktop.

`row-reverse` and `column-reverse` should be used in specific situation. The visual order of elements should be the same visually and in the HTML code. [Refer to flex-direction - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction) for more information

In your CSS file:

Before `/*** 4. CARD ***/`, add a new comment: `/* Section Latest news ============================= */`

Under that comment section, target the `row` class inside `section-latest-news` class
- Property: `flex-direction`, Value: `row-reverse`

The Latest news should appear in a reverse order.

File: `2-index.html`, `2-styles.css`

## 3. Simplify services list
Using the files from the previous task for this task:

`flex-wrap` is a property that can force the flex items to be in one or multiple lines. Learn more about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap).

In the `Services section` of `3-index.html`, remove the second `ul` and put the 3 `li` elements under the first `ul`

Now, in your CSS file, before `/*** 4. CARD ***/`, add a new comment: `/* Section SERVICES ============================= */`

Under that comment section, add a new selector targeting the `row` class inside the `section-services` class
- Property: `flex-wrap`, Value: `wrap`
File: `3-index.html`, `3-styles.css`

## 4. Playing around with the spacing between flex service items
Using the files from the previous task for this task:

In `4-styles.css` file, within the Grid section
- In `.col-1-3` selector
    - Replace the current width with `calc((100% / 3) - 2rem)`
- In `.col-1-2` selector
    - Replace the current width with `calc((100% / 2) - 2rem)`
- In `[class*='col-']`
    - Remove the padding declaration
    - Set Property: `margin` to `1rem`
- In `ul.row` declaration
    - Replace the current margin with `-1rem`

File: `4-index.html`, `4-styles.css`

## 5. Flexify the header
Using the files from the previous task for this task:

In your `5-index.html` file, inside the Header section
- Wrap the div with class `header-logo` and the nav with class `navbar-menu` with a `div` that has `header-container` as a class

In your `5-styles.css` file
- Inside the `/* Header` section
    - Add a selector for the `header-container` class
        - Property: `display`, Value: `flex`
        - Property: `justify-content`, Value: `space-between`
    - Remove `header-logo` and `header-logo a` rules
    - Remove the `navbar-menu` rule
- In the variables section
    - Remove
        - `header-logo-position`
        - `header-logo-link-display`
        - `header-logo-link-position`
        - `header-logo-link-top`
        - `header-logo-link-left`

File: `5-index.html`, `5-styles.css`
